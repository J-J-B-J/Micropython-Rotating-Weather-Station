# Micropython Rotating Weather Station

### An adaption of [jbee8/3D-Printed-Rotating-Weather-Station](https://github.com/jbee8/3D-Printed-Rotating-Weather-Station/) for Micropython

Not to be used stand-alone.
You should use the [instructions](https://core-electronics.com.au/projects/3d-printed-pico-weather-display/) of the original project in full,
but just swap out the code for the microcontroller in step 3.
