# Micropython Rotating Weather Station

### An adaption of [jbee8/3D-Printed-Rotating-Weather-Station](https://github.com/jbee8/3D-Printed-Rotating-Weather-Station/) for ESP32-C3-Zero

This is a completely different project to the aforementioned weather station, but the idea is based on it.
The code was made completely from scratch.

This program uses your [ESP32-C3-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-c3-zero.htm) to connect to the OpenWeather API and get weather for your current location.
It then programs its built-in LED to show colours that reflect this.
